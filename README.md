# heat-quilt

### Heat Quilt is a data display project done for DXARTS 472: Machatronic Art, Design, and Fabrication II.

### Project Description:

It is a crochet quilt representing a data heat map, which is a data visulization technique that sepperates data in subsections using two variables then displayes them in a grid, usingusing heat to represent quanitites of data rather than color or shade. The project is aimed to examine our current state of data visulization and representation to find a more embodied and appreciative form of interacting with data. 

This project drew inspiration from the concepts of data humanism and data feminism, as discussed in Georigia Lupi's work Data Humanism: *The Revolutionary Future of Data Visualization* and Data Feminism as discussed in Catherine D'Ignazio and Lauren Klein's book *Data Feminism*. Data today is so far removed from embodiment, from the source it represents. By brining physicality back to the numbers and categories of data, I mean to depart data from the human superiority that reigns over it.

### Progress:

Heat Quilt began with construction of different forms of heat producing circuits. Various iterations and techniques used in this design can be referenced in the folder "Heat Producuing Cirucit Design Archive." The current form of design is .png in this folder.

An arduino circuit supporting heating two sections on the quilt has been made, the design of this circuit can be referenced in the folder "Arduino Code and Cirucit" along with the Arduino code supporting it.

The aesthetic design of this project can be referenced in the folder "Quilt Design Documentation". Likewise, video documentation of this project (as of 5/17/2021) is in this folder as well.


### To Use:

Recreate the heat producing circuit as in "Quilt Design Documentation" and run the code also in this folder.
